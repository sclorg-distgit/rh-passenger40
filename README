Package %{scl_name} provides Nginx web server as a Software
Collection.  For more information about Software Collections, see
scl(1).  By installing the %{scl_name} collection, you will get a
minimal set of packages to have a working Nginx web server.

%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7
Usage: systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}nginx
%else
Usage: service %{?scl_prefix}nginx start
%endif

Software Collections allows use of applications which are not located
in the filesystem root hierarchy but are present in an alternative
location, which is %{_scl_root} in case of the %{scl_name}
collection.

Nginx is a web server and a reverse proxy server for HTTP, SMTP, POP3 and
IMAP protocols, with a strong focus on high concurrency, performance and low
memory usage.

When working with the %{scl_name} collection, use the "scl" utility
(see scl(1) for usage) to enable the scl environment properly.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located under %{_sysconfdir}.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with argument --arg within %{scl_name} software collections
  environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run interactive shell where %{scl_name} software collection is enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man nginx'
  Show man pages for nginx command, which is part of the %{scl_name} software
  collection.
